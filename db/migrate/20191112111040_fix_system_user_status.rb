    # The previous migration was supposed to make the system user active,
    # but doesn't since it only touches built-in (0) users while the system user
    # used to be locked (3). An oversight on our part.
    #
    # We also update the anonymous user again. While it was correctly updated
    # in the previous migration, newly created anonymous users since have the
    # wrong status (0) because we failed to update the on-the-fly
    # creation of the anonymous user with the correct status.

    # active at this point already anyway. The previous migration then makes it
