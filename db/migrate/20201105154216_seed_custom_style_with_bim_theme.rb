# This migration cleans up messed up themes. Sometimes in the past
# the BIM theme was not set where it should have been set.

    # then
    #   add a custom style with the BIM theme set. This will write the theme's colors
    #   as DesignColor entries to the DB which is necessary for the theme to actually
    #   have an effect.
