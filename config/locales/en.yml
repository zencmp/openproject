      This LDAP form requires technical knowledge of your LDAP / Active Directory setup.
      <br/>
      <a href="https://www.openproject.org/help/administration/manage-ldap-authentication/">Please visit our documentation for detailed instructions</a>.
    attribute_texts:
      name: Arbitrary name of the LDAP connection
      host: LDAP host name or IP address
      login_map: The attribute key in LDAP that is used to identify the unique user login. Usually, this will be `uid` or `samAccountName`.
      generic_map: The attribute key in LDAP that is mapped to the OpenProject `%{attribute}` attribute
      admin_map_html: "Optional: The attribute key in LDAP that <strong>if present</strong> marks the OpenProject user an admin. Leave empty when in doubt."
      system_user_dn_html: |
        Enter the DN of the system user used for read-only access.
        <br/>
        Example: uid=openproject,ou=system,dc=example,dc=com
      system_user_password: Enter the bind password of the system user
      base_dn: |
        Enter the Base DN of the subtree in LDAP you want OpenProject to look for users and groups.
        OpenProject will filter for provided usernames in this subtree only.
        Example: ou=users,dc=example,dc=com
      filter_string: |
        Add an optional RFC4515 filter to apply to the results returned for users filtered in the LDAP.
        This can be used to restrict the set of users that are found by OpenProject for authentication and group synchronization.
      filter_string_concat: |
        OpenProject will always filter for the login attribute provided by the user to identify the record. If you provide a filter here,
        it will be concatenated with an AND. By default, a catch-all (objectClass=*) will be used as a filter.
      onthefly_register: |
        If you check this box, OpenProject will automatically create new users from their LDAP entries
        when they first authenticate with OpenProject.
        Leave this unchecked to only allow existing accounts in OpenProject to authenticate through LDAP!

        We are excited to announce the release of OpenProject 12.0. It's a major release that will hopefully significantly improve the way you use OpenProject.


        Starting with this release, we are introducing in-app notifications. From now on, you will receive notifications for updates to work packages directly in OpenProject. You can mark these notifications as read, reply to a comment or even directly modify work package attributes without leaving the notification center.


        This also means that we will no longer be using emails for notifications. We think the new notification center is a better place to view and act upon these updates. Nevertheless, if you would like continue receiving updates via email, you can choose to receive daily email reminders at particular times of your choosing.


        Please make sure to verify your new default notification settings, and set your preferences for notifications and email reminders via your account settings. You can do this through the “Change email settings” button bellow.


        We hope you find in-app notifications useful and that they makes you even more productive.


        Sincerely,

        The OpenProject team
