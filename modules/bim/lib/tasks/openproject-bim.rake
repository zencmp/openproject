# This file contains code that helps extracting seed data from real OP instances.
# It is meant to be copy & pasted into the rails console of the the instance from which you want
# to extract the data from.

# It is very unstable code. However, it should never change the instance it runs in. However, use it with caution.

## Before using it, make sure:
# that the default language is :en
# that the seeded status, types, and priority names have never been changed
# that all subjects are unique:
#   project_identifiers = %w(construction-project bcf-management seed-daten creating-bim-model)
#   projects = Project.where(identifier: project_identifiers)
#   all_wps = projects.map(&:work_packages).flatten
#   all_wps.group_by(&:subject).select { |subject, members| members.size > 1 }.each { |subject, members| puts "#{subject}\t#{members.map(&:id).join("\t")}" }
